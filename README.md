Lightweight Portfolio

This is a minimal, responsive portfolio built with pure HTML and CSS. It's intended for a backend-focused engineer with fullstack, game, and C++ experience.

Files
- `index.html` — the main page
- `css/styles.css` — styles

Images
- Place project screenshots under `assets/images/`.
- Default filenames referenced by the site:
	- `project-jobqueue.jpg`
	- `project-tooling.jpg`
	- `project-observability.jpg`

How to preview
Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click in Explorer or use a local HTTP server).

Customize
- Replace "Your Name" and contact information in `index.html`.
- Add or replace project images in `assets/images/` using the filenames above (or update the `src` attributes in `index.html`).
- Swap colors in `css/styles.css` under `:root`.

Hosting
This is a static site — deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static host.

Notes
- We used a matcha-inspired color palette. We can add CDN image optimization later if you want.
